Notes:
1. You need to recon the speed of the cube to decide when to remain static and when to press the button to stop the cube.
2. You need to count the number of times the cube has reached the target to decide when to press the button to stop the cube.
3. The video clips I give you are continuous, so do not re-count the number of times if cube has just reached the target for both previous and current video clips.
4. If you think the cube is about to reach the target for the expected number of times, you should press the button to stop the cube directly.
5. The target is a purple disk.
